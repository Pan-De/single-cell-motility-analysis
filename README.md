# High-throughput Single Cell Motility Analysis using Nanowell-in-Microwells
This document contains instructions on how to access the data associated with the submitted manuscript **"High-throughput Single Cell Motility Analysis using Nanowell-in-Microwells"**. We developed a deep learning model that can classify cell motility state (migrating/idle state) from fluorescent microscopy images of single cells.

* Cell Type: MDA-MB-231 cell line.
* Cells were staied with Calcein AM and imaged inside [nanowell-in-microwell plates](https://www.imagecyte.bio/)
* Class: Migrating cells (motility >5 µm/hour), Idle cells (motility <5 µm/hour)



**Datasets for k-fold corss validation** <br>
